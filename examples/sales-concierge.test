I’m assuming your AI can read the inventory sheet and use the “Avg Unit Cost” as a quoted starting price.

Before I confirm: any note on color/shade for the silk, or should we share available options?

User: Share options. Also if I don’t like fabric can I return?
Bot (Message node): Responding for: returns_policy
Bot (AI Reply): For unstitched fabric, return/exchange depends on condition and time window:

Must be unused, not cut/altered, packaging intact.
If the wrong item is delivered or there’s a defect, we resolve it promptly.

For custom-stitched outfits, they’re generally not refundable (made to measurements). If a fit issue is due to our measurement/stitching, we fix it per adjustment policy.

I’ll share available silk shade options next—do you prefer light / medium / dark tones?

User: Medium tones. Confirm order.
Bot (Message node): Responding for: confirm_order
Bot (AI Reply): Confirmed. We’ll proceed with:

Delivery for items + COD

Silk medium-tone options shared for your selection

Tailor visit Sunday 5pm for measurements and stitching quote finalization

You can also send any design reference photos before Sunday to speed up the visit.

If you want, I can also generate a second conversation to test low stock / reorder behavior (e.g., chiffon dupatta has only 23 pieces) and a third to test alteration service (SRV-ALTER) routing.
